# Windows Blind Files

In some cases during exploitation you as an attacker gain the ability to read are "verify" arbitrary files. As an attacker you need go-to files that cover as many versions as possible in order to either confirm exploitation or gather intelligence on the exploited system. This is what a "blind file" is.

| File		| Description / Importance |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
|  %SYSTEMDRIVE%\boot.ini  | A file that can be counted on to be on virtually every windows host. Helps with confirmation that a read is happening. **WARNING - in more recent versions of Windows this file in no longer there.** |
|  %WINDIR%\win.ini  |  This is another file that can be counted on to be readable by all users of a system. |
| %SYSTEMROOT%\repair\SAM <br> %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\config\RegBack\SAM | |
